# Dojo-Hangman
Hey team! We've almost got our Hangman game working. There are just a few bugs left that we need to try to take care of before we can send it out to our customers!

If possible, work in teams of two and select the bug you want to fix. Work on it, and when you have it fixed, check it in to share it with your team members. Don't forget to add a comment when you check it in!

Note: The only file you should change is *Program.cs* in the *HangmanConsoleGame* project.
